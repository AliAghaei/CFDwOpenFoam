This is a tutorial on how to simulate laminar vortex shedding across
a 2D cylinder in OpenFoam. Laminar vortex shedding occurs for Reynolds numbers
50 < Re < 200 and the wake becomes turbulent for 200 < Re < 300, 
so make sure the simulation satisfies this criteria.

The solver used is pisoFoam which is generally a solver used for
turbulent, transient flow. However the turbulence is turned off
in this simulation as we want to simulate laminar flow.

Pay special attention to the files:

* -- 0/U -- Boundary/initial conditions for velocity filed U
* -- 0/p -- Boundary/initial conditions for pressure filed p

* -- constant/transportProperties -- Where you change the kinematic 
				      viscocity and thus the Reynolds 
			              number of the simulation

* -- constant/polymesh  --------- Folder containing all the mesh data
* -- constant/poymesh/boundary -- Naming of all the boundary patches
 		                  The names of all the boundary patches
                                  must be identical to names used in the 
                                  constant/U and constant/p files

* -- system/controlDict -- Where you change the timestep, tolerance, simulation time etc
